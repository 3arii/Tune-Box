## How to install it?

It is extremely simple, you have to grab the source code from the latest build, then put them in a single repo, finally run the HTML file which will load the page with preset songs.

How to add your songs?

The songs are stored in an array in the main.js file. You have to access it and add your new songs. To install a song you
should get the mp3 version and a cover photo(makes the program look much better and makes you easily recongnize the song
, thys highly suggested but not obligatory) Just add them to the array like the presets shown in it

##  What's in the Oven?

* Add a function to let the user add songs without getting into the JS code.
* Add a function to shuffle play the list.(Almost done)
* Add a function to automatically retrieve the cover picture of any song.
* Make an online array of songs where the user can buy and add them to their list.
